I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

For this workshop majorly I learned the concept of memory allocation and deallocation. Memory allocation and deallocation are important aspects of 
managing dynamic memory, which is memory that is allocated at runtime rather than being determined at compile-time. This dynamic memory management 
is typically done using operators 'new' and 'delete' keywords. Additionally, reading from files was another important practice in this workshop.
Lastly, the concept of function overloading was a major chunk of this workshop - Function overloading is a feature where multiple functions can have 
the same name but differ in the type or number of their parameters. This allows us to define several functions with the same name that perform similar 
operations on different types of data or with different parameter combinations.

At a personal level, fixing memory leaks was a major challenge for me in this workshop. As a beginner, learning this new concept and properly adhering 
to the rules of memory allocation and deallocation to prevent any memory leaks was difficult. I had to go through my code, understand the error message
, and revise the basics for a lot of time to finally deallocate all the memory that I had allocated earlier.
